# fullstackopen-exercises

This repo contains the resolutions to the exercises from the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/)

## Stucture

The stucture was split between the different projects across the different parts of the course.
All projects have the commulative exercises from that part of the course.
Each new commit is annotated with the last exercise number of the exercise series.

E.g., commit "Exercise 2.14: resolution" contains the sorce code for the resolutions of the exercises [2.11-2.14](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server#exercises-2-11-2-14).

There are a few exceptions for this, where there were more than one commit per exercise series.
Also, for some practical exercises, the project folder in that part of the course contains evidence of the exercise resolution, and useful links, like the repo containing deployed code.
